<p>I think classes defined is the most difficult for learner in the OOP method of programming. So in these courses of
    learning to solve sudoku,
    we don&#8217;t explain how to make a class, property, and methods in detail. But just make a explanation of the
    existed classes, properties and methods in this library to learners.
    So we can explain these data structures as a simulator environment to solve a sudoku like a human being.</p>

<p>We can first image that there are 9x9 houses in a beautiful valley, and they are build like:</p>
<img alt="_images/p4.png" src="_images/p4.png"/>

<div class="topic">
    <p class="topic-title first"><strong>An Imagined World</strong></p>

    <p>There are 9 countries, every country has 9 people. They decide to live together in this beautiful valley. And
        there are 9x9 houses, They want to let every people live in one house, and every X-way line, Y-way line,
        and every 3x3 box include all countries&#8217; people. And if so, they can say themselves are a real united
        group in the world, can you help them?</p>
</div>
<p>and then we can start to solve the wondeful world for these people...</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-a-class-and-an-object">
    <h2>What is a Class? and an Object?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-class-and-an-object"
                                          title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

    <p>Class is collective name for a group of objects which have same behaviors, features, forms. So, animal can be a
        class name, and elephant is an kind of object of this class.</p>

    <p>An object is thing which belong a class or multi classes.You can treat an object is an entity of a class, like
        human is a class, but you is an object, an entity which belong human class.</p>

    <p>Depend to the domain which we want to approach,or to define, we will define some different classes to describe
        the same objects. Like if we want to design a system to manage houses in a place, we may define a
        house class, that contain some people, some pets, and so on... But when our domain is to know all relationships
        of person, we may define a person class that contain some people, but no pets,
        except we want to study the pets factor in a person relationship.</p>

    <p>In this sudoku solving library, we define the following classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p class="first">Number Class:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <div><p>You can treat every number as a different man, there are 9 countries, and every country has 9
                    men. So we can treat the Number Class as a Country Class.
                    Every country has their ID, here is 1-9, and every country would record the positions where their
                    people live in this valley.</p>
                </div>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li><p class="first">Point Class:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <div><p>Point is a house here. It indicate that there is empty or not, if it is not empty, which country
                    people lives there? if it is empty, which counties&#8217; people can live here?</p>
                </div>

        </li>
        <li><p class="first">GroupBase Class:</p>

                    how many people have lived in this group? and which counties&#8217; people still not live in this
