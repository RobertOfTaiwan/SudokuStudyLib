                        <p>The basic logic is dichotomy, is True or False in human language, or is 0 or 1 in computer
                            language. It is the smallest and simplest classification which human can recognize
                            and communicate with each other. So learning logic for children and young men is very
                            important, because this is the base of all knowledge, and the base of all religion.</p>

                        <p>Learning logic can be a very happy thing if we teach it as a game, and Sudoku is the one.
                            There are several good reasons to study logic by Solving sudoku:</p>

                        <p>Learning a computer language is the nature way to learn logic. Python is a interpreter script
                            language, you can get every resource from <a class="reference external"
                                                                         href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>.
                            I recite a period of Python FAQ&lt;<a class="reference external"
                                                                  href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html">https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html</a>&gt;
                            about for the beginning programmers:</p>
                        <dl class="docutils">
                            <dt>Q:</dt>
                            <dd>Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?</dd>
                            <dt>A:</dt>
                            <dd><p class="first">Yes.</p>

                                <p>It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed language
                                    such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be better served by
                                    learning Python as their first language. Python has a very simple and consistent
                                    syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a
                                    beginning programming course lets students concentrate on important programming
                                    skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students can
                                    be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can
                                    probably even work with user-defined objects in their very first course.</p>

                                <p>For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language
                                    seems unnatural. It presents additional complexity that the student must master and
                                    slows the pace of the course. The students are trying to learn to think like a
                                    computer, decompose problems, design consistent interfaces, and encapsulate data.
                                    While learning to use a statically typed language is important in the long term, it
                                    is not necessarily the best topic to address in the students&#8217; first
                                    programming course.</p>

                                <p>Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java, Python has a
                                    large standard library so that students can be assigned programming projects very
                                    early in the course that do something. Assignments aren&#8217;t restricted to the
                                    standard four-function calculator and check balancing programs. By using the
                                    standard library, students can gain the satisfaction of working on realistic
                                    applications as they learn the fundamentals of programming. Using the standard
                                    library also teaches students about code reuse. Third-party modules such as PyGame
                                    are also helpful in extending the students&#8217; reach.</p>

                                <p class="last">Python&#8217;s interactive interpreter enables students to test language
                                    features while they&#8217;re programming. They can keep a window with the
                                    interpreter running while they enter their program&#8217;s source in another window.
                                    If they can&#8217;t remember the methods for a list, they can do something like
                                    this:</p>
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
