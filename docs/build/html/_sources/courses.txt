Courses
=======

We can arrange these courses as a sudoku summer camp. We can prepare 1-6 different level sudokus. The learners don't need to learn all levels. 
The purpose of these courses is NOT to teach all solving methods of sudoku, its purpose is logic learning. So, we can let different learners have their suitable target to learn.
