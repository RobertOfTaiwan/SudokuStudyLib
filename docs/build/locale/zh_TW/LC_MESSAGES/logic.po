"It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed "
"language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be "
"better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very "
"simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most "
"importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course lets students "
"concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition "
"and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to "

"Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java, "

"balancing programs. By using the standard library, students can gain the "
"satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they learn the "
"fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also teaches "
