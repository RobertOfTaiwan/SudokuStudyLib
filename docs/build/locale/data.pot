msgid "I think classes defined is the most difficult for learner in the OOP method of programming. So in these courses of learning to solve sudoku, we don't explain how to make a class, property, and methods in detail. But just make a explanation of the existed classes, properties and methods in this library to learners. So we can explain these data structures as a simulator environment to solve a sudoku like a human being."
