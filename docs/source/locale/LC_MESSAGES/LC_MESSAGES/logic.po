" 1 in computer language. It is the smallest and simplest classification "

"It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed "
"language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be "
"better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very "
"simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most "
"importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course lets students "
"concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition "
"and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to "
"basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can probably even work "

"For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed "
"language seems unnatural. It presents additional complexity that the student"

"learn to think like a computer, decompose problems, design consistent "
"interfaces, and encapsulate data. While learning to use a statically typed "

"Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java, "
"Python has a large standard library so that students can be assigned "
"programming projects very early in the course that do something. Assignments"
" aren't restricted to the standard four-function calculator and check "
"balancing programs. By using the standard library, students can gain the "
"satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they learn the "
"fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also teaches "
"students about code reuse. Third-party modules such as PyGame are also "
